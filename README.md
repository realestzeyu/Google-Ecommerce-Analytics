# üìä Google Ecommerce Analytics: Causal Impact of Paid Advertising

## üìå Introduction  
> **"Correlation ‚â† Causation"**

While widely cited, this principle is often overlooked in business analytics.  
This project rigorously examines whether paid advertising **causes** higher conversions compared to organic traffic.

> **Naivety of A/B Testing**

While randomised controlled trials such as A/B tests remain the gold standard for causal inference, real-world constraints often make them impractical:

1. **Limitations of Randomisation**  
   In practice, treatments and control groups are rarely truly randomised. It is often extremely difficult to achieve perfect random sampling irl.

2. **Cost of Experimentation**  
   It is usually more practical to work with existing observational datasets rather than running an entirely new experiment or campaign.  
   *Example:* Instead of testing an advertising campaign on different randomised groups, you might simply run the campaign for everyone.

3. **Ethical Concerns**  
   Some experiments raise ethical issues or are wholly unacceptable to conduct, particularly when the treatment could potentially harm individuals or groups.

Thus, this project will take a more practical approach by using **general observational data**.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview  
**Google Merchandise Store (GMS)** Analytics  

üîó [Google Analytics BigQuery Public Dataset](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7586738#where-the-data-comes-from&zippy=%2Cin-this-article)

The `ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce` dataset (available via BigQuery Public Datasets) contains:
- **Sample period**: 2020-11-01 to 2021-01-31 (3 months)  
- **Data type**: BigQuery GA4 event export  
- **Size**: 500,000+ raw rows requiring cleaning and transformation

### üìä Dataset Features  
The sample dataset contains obfuscated Google Analytics 360 data from the **Google Merchandise Store**, a real ecommerce store that sells Google-branded merchandise.

It includes:
- **Traffic source data**: Info on where visitors come from ‚Äî e.g. organic search, paid search, display ads.
- **Content data**: Behavioural metrics ‚Äî e.g. page URLs viewed, interaction with content.
- **Transactional data**: Ecommerce details like purchases and revenue.

## ‚ùì Research Question  

> **Does paid advertising drive significantly higher conversion rates compared to organic visits?**

This study explores:
- ‚úÖ Whether paid traffic (e.g., CPC/CPM) converts better than organic
- ‚úÖ Which channels perform better for specific user segments
- ‚úÖ Whether observed correlations can be interpreted causally

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Clean and filter ~500K raw GA4 event records  
- Handle missing data and normalise unconventional values

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Examine feature distributions and conversion rates  
- Understand treatment vs. control group characteristics  
- Identify potential confounders

### 3. **Causal Inference**
- Build causal DAG / Bayesian Network to visualise relationships  
- Estimate causal effect using:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
  - Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)
- Estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

### 4. **Validation & Conclusion**
- Perform sensitivity analysis to check robustness  
- Summarise key insights and recommendations

### 5. **BI Dashboard**
- Interactive summary
